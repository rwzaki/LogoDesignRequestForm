# LogoDesignRequestForm
This simple form was developed as part of the Responsive Web Design Course by FreeCodeCamp. The form is meant to be as an initial step for logo designers to better understand their clients' requests, wherrein the client will have to fill this form.

NOTE: The form is still not responsive with mobile screens. Mainly, at the moment the form is justa static webpage to showcase whatever tasks I worked on. Hopefully it will be enhanced later on.
