# Logo Design Request From

![Project Preview](/LogoDesignRequestFormScreenshot.png)

This repository contains the source code for a Logo Design Request From webpage, which was created as part of the Responsive Web Design course on FreeCodeCamp. The form is meant to be as an initial step for logo designers to better understand their clients' requests, wherein the client will have to fill this form. The webpage showcases my designing skills and demonstrates proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
